# Identifying traffic signs 


Identifing ***traffic signs using our Convoultional neural networks***, obtained and accuracy of **~98%**


Undertook various steps to improve the accuracy of the model by 
- Fine tuning our model
- using drop out layers
- Using a fit generator
- did Data Agumentation to produce agumented images to improve our training process and 
gain more accuracy. 

### Increase the accuracy from an initial ~92% (LeNet model) to 98% ( Modified model )
 
**Traffic signs dataset from https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs**

**our CNN has**
- 4 convolutional layers
- 2 pooling layers
- 1 hidden layer
