This project of Self driving car has been broken down into sections where in each section I have got to learn many things.
## *In glimpse -*
- Used **Computer Vision techniques via OpenCV** to identify lane lines for a self-driving car.

- Learned to train a **Perceptron-based Neural Network to classify between binary classes.**

- Learned to train **Convolutional Neural Networks to identify between various traffic signs.**

- Trained **Deep Neural Networks to fit complex datasets.**

- **Mastered Keras,** a power Neural Network library written in Python.

## Builded and trained a fully functional self driving car to drive on its own!
